# 🔐 REPLIT SECRETS SETUP

## How to set environment variables in Replit:

1. In Replit, click the **"Secrets"** button (🔒 icon on the left sidebar)
2. Add these secrets:

```
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
APPLICATION_ID=1097878151713017896
```

## Why this is safe:
- Secrets are NOT stored in code
- Secrets are NOT pushed to GitHub
- Only Replit has access to them
- GitHub shows no exposed tokens
